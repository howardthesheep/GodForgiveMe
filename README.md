# The Catholic App®
A gift for my dear mother.


## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is this application?
This web application could be considered a virtual divine consultant. In many 
ways, it functions just as a traditional Catholic confessional. Your virtual,
anonymous space to both confess your sins and receive penance.

### Why... did you build this?
For many years my mother asked me to put my abilities as a computer scientist 
to good use. She provided me with many ideas for potential ventures, but there
was one idea she would never forget. The Catholic App®. 

I tried to shake her of it. Arguing, "Mom, don't you think that this kind of 
application undercuts the emotional and religious value found in a traditional
 confessional?"

"No. Will you please just build me my Catholic App®?"

So despite my better judgement, here it is. In all of its God honoring glory.
